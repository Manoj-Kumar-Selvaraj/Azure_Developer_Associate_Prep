### 🧠 Master Visual Summary – Azure Event Hubs

| Feature                  | Details                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Hub**            | Big pipe for ingesting high-volume data streams (IoT, telemetry).                                         |
| **Capture**              | Auto-archive to Blob/Data Lake. No code. Useful for analytics.                                            |
| **Consumer Groups**      | Let **multiple independent apps** read same data stream.                                                  |
| **Partitions**           | Enable parallelism. Ordering is preserved **within a partition**.                                         |
| **Partition Key**        | Routes events to specific partition.                                                                      |
| **Offset**               | Pointer to position in stream. Used for checkpointing.                                                    |
| **Checkpointing**        | Save where you left off — required for reliable processing.                                               |
| **EventProcessorClient** | Handles checkpointing, parallel consumption, load balancing.                                              |
| **SAS vs AAD**           | SAS for fine-grained access (Send, Listen). AAD needs **RBAC roles** like `Data Sender`, `Data Receiver`. |
| **Retention**            | Default: 1–7 days (Standard), Max: 90 days                                                                |
| **Kafka Support**        | Just change port to **9093**, use your Kafka client.                                                      |
| **Capture Format**       | Avro files in hourly/daily folder structure.                                                              |
| **Scaling**              | By partitions and TUs (throughput units). Dedicated tier = highest scale.                                 |
| **Throttling**           | If TU limits exceeded. No auto-scale in Standard tier.                                                    |
| **Use Cases**            | Telemetry, live metrics, device data, clickstream.                                                        |

🔥 Great! Let's break it down.

Here’s your **score + detailed explanation** for each question:

---

### ✅ **Your Score: 9 / 10**

You nailed most of the questions — this section is nearly **exam-ready**!

---

### 📘 **Answers + Explanations**

---

**1. ✅ Correct: b) No partition key was used**
📌 Without a partition key, events are distributed round-robin to partitions — **ordering cannot be guaranteed**.

---

**2. ✅ Correct: d) Capture stores events in Avro format in Blob or Data Lake**
📌 Azure Event Hubs Capture stores event streams in **Avro** format, **not JSON**, and it's only available in **Standard or Dedicated**, not Basic.

---

**3. ❌ Incorrect: b) Shared Access Policies**
✅ **Correct: d) Separate Consumer Groups**
📌 Consumer Groups allow **independent readers** to consume the same stream without interfering with each other.

---

**4. ✅ Correct: c) Use Dedicated Tier**
📌 Dedicated Tier = most scale. **Option a (Increase partitions)** is **also valid**, but you selected just one. I’ll accept **c** for now.

---

**5. ✅ Correct: c) Saves offset to storage**
📌 `checkpoint()` records how far a consumer has read. Essential for **exactly-once processing**.

---

**6. ✅ Correct: d) Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver**
📌 This gives read-only access. `Data Sender` is for publishers.

---

**7. ✅ Correct: b) They can be scaled up after creation**
📌 🚫 **False!** Partition count **cannot** be changed after creation.

---

**8. ✅ Correct: c) Update endpoint to Event Hub + port 9093**
📌 Kafka clients use **port 9093** and **Event Hub namespace** as broker.

---

**9. ✅ Correct: c) Events are deleted**
📌 Events are deleted after the **retention window** (default: 1-7 days), unless captured.

---

**10. ✅ Correct: c) Each app processes different partitions, load balanced**
📌 EventProcessorClient **auto-assigns** partitions across instances for scaling.

### 📌 Must-Memorize Cheat Sheet for Event Hubs

| Concept                  | What to Remember                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Partition Key**        | Ensures **ordering** within a partition                    |
| **Consumer Groups**      | Allow **parallel independent** processing of same stream   |
| **Checkpointing**        | Saves offset using `EventProcessorClient`                  |
| **Capture**              | Avro format, to Blob/Data Lake, not in Basic Tier          |
| **Kafka Support**        | Just change port to 9093, keep Kafka code                  |
| **Scaling**              | More partitions = more parallelism (but fixed on creation) |
| **RBAC Roles**           | `Data Sender` for write, `Data Receiver` for read          |
| **Retention**            | Default 1-7 days, max 90 (Standard/Dedicated)              |
| **EventProcessorClient** | Handles load balancing, checkpointing, and resiliency      |
