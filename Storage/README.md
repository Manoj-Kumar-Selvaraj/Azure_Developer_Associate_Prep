## 🔹 1. What is an Azure Storage Account?

An **Azure Storage Account** is a container that gives you access to Azure Storage services:

* **Blob Storage** (for unstructured data like images, videos)
* **File Storage** (for shared files via SMB)
* **Queue Storage** (for message queuing between components)
* **Table Storage** (for NoSQL key-value data)
* **Disk Storage** (for virtual machine disks)

---

## 🔹 2. Storage Account Types

| Type                    | Use Case                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Purpose v2**  | Default. Supports all features (Blob, Queue, Table, Disk) |
| **General Purpose v1**  | Legacy. Lower cost, fewer features                        |
| **Blob Storage**        | Optimized for blob storage only                           |
| **Premium Performance** | For high IOPS (mainly for Disks, Files)                   |

---

## 🔹 3. Performance Tiers

| Tier         | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard** | Backed by HDD. Cost-effective.               |
| **Premium**  | Backed by SSD. High throughput & low latency |

---

## 🔹 4. Access Tiers (Blob only)

| Tier        | Use Case                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Hot**     | Frequent access data                |
| **Cool**    | Infrequent access, stored ≥ 30 days |
| **Archive** | Rare access, stored ≥ 180 days      |

---

## 🔹 5. Redundancy Options

| Redundancy                          | Description                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **LRS** – Locally redundant storage | 3 copies in same region        |
| **ZRS** – Zone redundant storage    | Across AZs in same region      |
| **GRS** – Geo-redundant storage     | Secondary region backup        |
| **RA-GRS** – Read-access GRS        | GRS + read access to secondary |

GRS replicates data asynchronously to a paired region
---

## 🔹 6. Blob Storage Deep Dive

**Blob types**:

* **Block blobs** – for files (images, logs, backups)
* **Append blobs** – for logs (only append allowed)
* **Page blobs** – for VHDs and disks (read/write random access)

### Blob URL structure:

```
https://<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blobname>
```

---

## 🔹 7. Security Features

* **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** – Delegated access to resources
* **Azure AD Authentication** – RBAC-based access control
* **Storage Account Keys** – Full admin-level access (primary & secondary)
* **Encryption** – Data encrypted at rest (Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys)

---

## 🔐 Azure Storage Security & Access Control

Azure offers **multiple ways to secure and access** your storage:

---

### ✅ 1. **Shared Key Authorization (Account Keys)**

* Every storage account has **two 512-bit access keys**
* Using either key gives **full access** to all resources (blobs, files, queues, tables)
* Used in **code, apps, or tools like AzCopy**

**🔺 Risk:** If leaked, it’s like handing out a master password

---

### ✅ 2. **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**

SAS provides **fine-grained, time-limited access** to storage resources.

#### 🔸 Types of SAS:

| Type                    | Scope                               | Use Case Example                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **User Delegation SAS** | Per-user (uses Azure AD)            | Access granted to a signed-in user     |
| **Service SAS**         | Specific service (blob, file, etc.) | Grant access to a file for 1 hour      |
| **Account SAS**         | Whole account                       | Grant full read access to all services |

#### ⚙️ With SAS, you can control:

* **Permissions** (read, write, delete, list, etc.)
* **Start/expiry time**
* **IP range restrictions**
* **Protocols** (HTTPS only)

**🧠 Exam Tip:** Always prefer SAS over Account Key in production for security.

---

### ✅ 3. **Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

* Uses **Azure AD identities** to control access to storage resources
* Supports **resource-level roles** like:

  * **Storage Blob Data Reader**
  * **Storage Blob Data Contributor**
* Works well for **serverless apps** or users authenticated via Azure AD

---

### ✅ 4. **Firewall & Virtual Network Rules**

* You can **restrict access** to your storage account from:

  * **Specific IP ranges**
  * **Virtual Networks (VNets)**
* Block access from public internet entirely if needed

---

### ✅ 5. **Private Endpoint**

* Maps your storage account to a **private IP** in your VNet
* Bypasses public internet — ensures **100% private access**

---

## 🧠 Security Best Practices for AZ-204:

| Situation                      | Recommended Access Method     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Web/mobile app uploads blob    | SAS Token (via backend)       |
| Azure Function writing to blob | Azure RBAC + Managed Identity |
| Admin connecting from on-prem  | Account Key (short-term use)  |
| Enterprise app (long-term)     | Private Endpoint + RBAC       |

---


## 🔹 8. Monitoring and Diagnostics

* **Azure Monitor**
* **Metrics** (Request Count, Success Rate, Egress/Ingress, Latency)
* **Diagnostic Logs** (Access logs, latency, errors)
* **Soft delete** and **Versioning** for blobs

---

## 🔹 9. Developer Features (AZ-204 Focus)

* Use **Azure SDKs** for .NET, Python, Node.js
* Use **Azure.Storage.Blobs** package in .NET
* Upload/Download blobs
* Generate SAS tokens in code
* Set blob metadata & properties
* Async operations for file handling
* Use **QueueClient** for inserting and reading messages

---

## 🔹 10. ARM/Bicep & Terraform Support

Define storage account as Infrastructure-as-Code:

```bicep
resource stg 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: { name: 'Standard_LRS' }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  properties: {
    accessTier: 'Hot'
  }
}
```

---

## 🔹 11. Common Developer Use Cases

* Host static websites on Blob storage
* Upload large files in chunks
* Store logs and diagnostics (append blobs)
* Use Queue storage to decouple components
* Use Tables for structured NoSQL data
* Connect via REST API or SDKs

---

🔹 What is Rehydration in Azure Blob Storage?
When you store a blob in the Archive tier, the blob becomes offline — you cannot read or modify it until it’s moved back to an online tier (Hot or Cool).
This process is called rehydration.

---

Great! Let’s move on to the **next major Azure Storage topic**:

---

## 🔄 **Azure Blob Lifecycle Management**

This is a powerful and exam-relevant feature — also extremely useful in real-world cost optimization.

---

## 🧠 What is Lifecycle Management?

> **Automatically move or delete blobs** based on **rules you define** (age, access, etc.)

This helps you:

* Reduce storage **costs**
* Retain data only as long as needed
* Clean up old or unused blobs

---

## 🔁 Example Scenarios

| Scenario                              | Action                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Delete blobs 30 days after upload     | `if blob age > 30 days → delete`             |
| Move logs to cool tier after 7 days   | `if blob age > 7 days → move to cool`        |
| Archive blobs not accessed in 90 days | `if last access > 90 days → move to archive` |

---

## 🧩 Storage Tiers Refresher

| Tier        | Use Case                         | Cost Model                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hot**     | Frequently accessed data         | High storage, low access cost                             |
| **Cool**    | Infrequently accessed (30+ days) | Lower storage, higher access                              |
| **Archive** | Rarely accessed (180+ days)      | Very cheap storage, expensive access (rehydration needed) |

---

## ⚙️ How to Use Lifecycle Management

1. Go to your **Storage Account** in Azure Portal
2. Navigate to **"Lifecycle management"**
3. Click **“+ Add a rule”**
4. Define:

   * **Filters** (by blob name prefix, container, tag)
   * **Conditions** (e.g., age > 30 days)
   * **Action** (move to cool/archive, delete)

---

## 🧪 Sample Rule (XML-style logic)

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "move-logs-to-cool",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["logs/"]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 7
            },
            "delete": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Cost-efficient**: Automatically archives or deletes unused data
✅ **Set and forget**: Runs in the background
✅ **Customizable**: Target specific containers, files, or blob types

## ✅ Quick Cheat Table (Most Common)

| Keyword                              | Meaning                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `blobTypes`                          | Must be `["blockBlob"]`        |
| `prefixMatch`                        | Filters blobs by folder/prefix |

---

## 🧪 Bonus Tip

In a real exam, they might show a JSON block and ask:

> What will happen to blobs under `logs/` after 90 days?

And your job is to **interpret the rule** based on these keywords.

---

 Can daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan be used without enabling last access tracking?
A: ❌ No. You must enable last access time tracking on the storage account.

---


# 🔁 **Soft Delete in Azure Blob Storage**

---

## ✅ What is Soft Delete?

> **Soft Delete** protects your data by allowing you to **recover blobs** that were **accidentally deleted or overwritten**.

Think of it like a **Recycle Bin** for blobs.

---

## 🧩 When is Soft Delete Useful?

* Accidentally deleted a file? ➜ **Recover it**
* Blob overwritten by mistake? ➜ **Restore previous version**
* Protection against app or user errors

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. You enable **Soft Delete** on the **storage account**.
2. You configure a **retention period** (1–365 days).
3. When a blob is deleted:

   * It's **not permanently deleted**
   * It's marked as `deleted: true`
   * You can **undelete it** during the retention period

---

## ⚙️ Example

If retention is set to **7 days**, and a blob is deleted:

* You can **restore** that blob **within 7 days**
* After 7 days, it's permanently deleted

---

## 💬 Soft Delete Applies To:

| Feature           | Supported? |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| **Block blobs**   | ✅ Yes      |
| **Append blobs**  | ✅ Yes      |
| **Page blobs**    | ✅ Yes      |
| **Blob versions** | ✅ Yes      |
| **Containers**    | ✅ Yes      |

---

## 🧪 Enabling Soft Delete (Portal)

1. Go to **Storage Account** → **Data protection**
2. Turn on **“Enable soft delete for blobs”**
3. Set the **retention period**

---

## 🧪 Enabling Soft Delete (CLI)

```bash
az storage blob service-properties delete-policy update \
  --account-name mystorageaccount \
  --enable true \
  --days-retained 30
```

---

## 🧠 Exam Key Points

| Topic           | Detail                                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default         | **Disabled** by default                                          |
| Retention Range | **1–365 days**                                                   |
| Recovery        | You can restore using **Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell, or SDKs** |
| Related Feature | Works with **blob versioning** for even better protection        |

---

## 👨‍🏫 Exam Tip:

You may get questions like:

> You enabled Soft Delete with 30 days retention. A blob was deleted 20 days ago. Can you recover it?

✔️ **Yes** — still within retention
✖️ **No**, if after 30 days

---

Thanks! Let's review your answers and explanations — you're doing great!

---

### ✅ **1. `c) It is stored with a unique version ID`** — ✔️ Correct

* When blob versioning is enabled, every **overwrite or delete operation** creates a **new version**, and the previous one is **preserved with a version ID**.

---

### ✅ **2. `a) Block blobs only`** — ✔️ Correct

* **Only block blobs** support versioning.
* Page blobs and append blobs are **not supported** for this feature.

---

### ✅ **3. `c) Use the blob’s version ID`** — ✔️ Correct

* To **access** or **restore** a specific version, you must specify the **version ID** in SDKs, CLI, or REST APIs.

---

### ❌ **4. `a) Enabled by default`** — ❌ Incorrect

* ✅ **Correct answer:** `c) Disabled by default and must be enabled manually`
* Blob versioning is **not enabled** by default — you need to **explicitly enable** it through Azure CLI, Portal, or ARM.

---

### ✅ **5. `c) The current blob is marked as deleted, older versions are retained`** — ✔️ Correct

* If you delete a blob while versioning is enabled, Azure **marks the current version as deleted** but **retains all previous versions** for recovery.

---
 Exam Tips
✅ Policies apply at the container level, not individual blob (unless versioning is enabled).

✅ You cannot delete a container with a locked immutable policy.

✅ Only blob versioning allows per-version WORM policies

✅ Legal hold has no expiration, removed manually

✅ CORS is only relevant for browser-based code accessing Azure Storage.

❌ CORS is not enforced for backend/server tools or for direct user navigation.

Browser + JavaScript code ⇒ 🔐 CORS is required

Anything else (user click, server code, curl) ⇒ ❌ CORS not required

| Access Method                                                    | Needs CORS? | Why?                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔗 **User clicks blob URL in browser** (e.g., direct download)   | ❌ **No**    | This is a **regular HTTP request**, not an AJAX request. CORS is not triggered. |
| ⚙️ **JavaScript (AJAX/fetch/XHR) in browser** accessing blob URL | ✅ **Yes**   | The browser enforces **CORS** when your JS code makes cross-origin calls.       |
| 🧪 **Postman / curl / server-side Python, Node.js, etc.**        | ❌ **No**    | These are **not restricted by browser CORS policies**.                          |
| ⚙️ **JavaScript accessing blob via custom domain (CDN, CNAME)**  | ✅ **Yes**   | Still a browser-to-browser-origin mismatch.                                     |

Excellent work! Let's go through each answer with explanations so you're 100% exam-ready. 🔥

---

## ✅ Your Answers:

`1.b, 2.a, 3.c, 4.b, 5.b`

---

### **1. You're building a JavaScript SPA hosted on `https://myapp.com` that fetches images from Azure Blob Storage. The request fails. What is MOST LIKELY missing?**

✔️ **Your Answer: b) CORS is not configured for `https://myapp.com`**
✅ **Correct**

* JavaScript apps making cross-origin requests (like from `myapp.com` to `blob.core.windows.net`) **need CORS configured** in Azure Blob Storage.
* The browser blocks it otherwise.

🧠 **Key Rule**: Browser-to-blob via JS = needs CORS.

---

### **2. Which services in Azure Storage support CORS?**

✔️ **Your Answer: a) Blob**
❌ **Partial Credit**

✅ **Correct Answer: a) Blob, b) File, c) Queue, d) Table**

All four services support CORS, although Table is less commonly used now.

💡 **Tip**: If a service can be accessed over HTTP from a browser app, it likely supports CORS.

---

### **3. You're using `fetch()` in JavaScript to retrieve a blob from Azure. The request is blocked by CORS. What should you check?**

✔️ **Your Answer: c) That the allowed origins and methods include your domain and HTTP verb**
✅ **Correct**

* For a CORS rule to work:

  * Your domain (`https://myapp.com`) must be listed in **Allowed Origins**
  * The HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) must be listed in **Allowed Methods**

🧠 Browsers do a **preflight OPTIONS request** to check this before letting your `fetch()` go through.

---

### **4. You're setting CORS via CLI and want to allow any domain to access the Blob Storage for GET requests. Which origin value should you use?**

✔️ **Your Answer: b) `*`**
✅ **Correct**

* The wildcard `"*"` allows **all origins**, but note:

  * You **cannot use `"*"`** if you want to **allow credentials** (`withCredentials: true`).
  * It’s fine for public blobs and anonymous access.

---

### **5. Which of the following requests does NOT require CORS?**

✔️ **Your Answer: b) A user clicking a direct download link to a blob URL**
✅ **Correct**

* Clicking a direct link is just a **regular HTTP request**, not a JS-initiated cross-origin request.
* No JavaScript = No CORS check.

---

Awesome! Let's dive into **Azure Storage Encryption**, another critical concept for the **AZ-204 exam** and for securing your applications in real-world deployments. 🔐

---

## 🔐 **Azure Storage Encryption Overview**

---

### ✅ What is it?

> Azure Storage **automatically encrypts** all data before persisting it and **decrypts** it when you access it — all transparently.

This is called **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**.

---

## ⚙️ **Types of Encryption in Azure Storage**

### 🔹 1. **SSE with Microsoft-Managed Keys (SSE-MMK)**

✅ Default option
🔒 Microsoft handles all key rotation and management
📦 No setup needed

---

### 🔹 2. **SSE with Customer-Managed Keys (SSE-CMK)**

🔑 You provide and manage your own encryption keys using **Azure Key Vault**
⚠️ You are responsible for key rotation, access policies, etc.
🎯 Often used in regulated industries

---

### 🔹 3. **SSE with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-CPK)**

🧾 You send the key with each request (via REST API or SDK)
📦 Key is not stored by Azure
🔒 Only used for **Blob Storage**
⚠️ You must handle key generation, transfer, and security

---

## 🧪 Summary Table

| Feature                     | SSE-MMK               | SSE-CMK                | SSE-CPK               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Key managed by              | Microsoft             | You (via Key Vault)    | You (per-request)     |
| Supports automatic rotation | ✅                     | ❌ (you manage)         | ❌                     |
| Use case                    | Default, general      | Regulated data, audits | Extreme control needs |
| Blob-only?                  | ❌ (All storage types) | ❌ (All storage types)  | ✅ (Blob only)         |

---

### ✅ Encryption in Transit

* Azure **also encrypts data in transit** using HTTPS/TLS.
* You must **always use HTTPS endpoints** when sending/receiving data.

---

### 💡 Additional Notes

* Azure Storage **never stores unencrypted data at rest**
* You can enforce HTTPS-only access at the **Storage Account level**
* Encryption is enabled by default — you **can’t turn it off**

---

## 👨‍🏫 Exam Tips

* ✅ Know that **encryption at rest is automatic and enabled by default**
* ✅ Understand the difference between **SSE-MMK, SSE-CMK, and SSE-CPK**
* ❌ You don’t need to implement encryption logic — unless using **SSE-CPK**
* ✅ For CMK, Key Vault is mandatory
* ✅ CPK is **not supported** with Azure Data Lake Gen2

---

❌ Incorrect
Correct Answer: b. Can set expiration centrally
Stored access policies allow centralized control (e.g., start/end time, permissions) for multiple SAS tokens, enabling easy revocation or update.
Not limited to Azure CLI.

❌ Incorrect
Correct Answer: b. Strong Consistency
Azure Blob Storage guarantees strong consistency — every read returns the most recent committed write.

❌ Incorrect
Correct Answer: d. Azure Service Bus (with sessions)
Azure Queue Storage does not guarantee FIFO, while Service Bus with sessions supports FIFO with strict message ordering.

✅ Correct
Answer: a, b
Premium storage provides high throughput and low latency, great for IOPS-intensive workloads.
❌ Not the cheapest for cold data.

❌ Incorrect
Correct Answer: d. This is not natively supported in Azure Storage
Azure doesn't support native container-level quotas. You must monitor usage externally and take action.

❌ Incorrect
Correct Answer: b. In the $web container
For static websites hosted on Azure Blob, you must use the $web container.

Excellent — those two areas are **frequently tested** in the AZ-204 exam and are **confusingly similar**, so let’s break them down **clearly and precisely**.

## ⚙️ **Event Grid vs Queue Storage vs Service Bus**

| Feature                             | **Event Grid**                                                        | **Queue Storage**                                                 | **Service Bus**                            |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**                            | Eventing (Push-based, pub-sub)                                        | Messaging (Pull-based)                                            | Enterprise Messaging (Advanced)            |
| **Use Case**                        | Notify multiple subscribers when an event occurs (e.g., blob created) | Pass messages between apps (e.g., decoupling producers/consumers) | Reliable, ordered, transactional messaging |
| **Trigger Pattern**                 | **Push** (event-driven)                                               | **Pull** (client must poll)                                       | **Push + Pull** (subscription-based)       |
| **Supports Dead-lettering?**        | ❌ No                                                                  | ✅ Yes (limited)                                                   | ✅ Yes (rich features)                      |

| **Retries / DLQ?**                  | Automatic retry with backoff                                          | Manual retry logic needed                                         | Built-in retry and DLQ                     |
| **Typical Message Size**            | Small (events, JSON: < 1 MB)                                          | Max 64 KB                                                         | Max 256 KB (standard), 100 MB (premium)    |
| **Fan-out? (Multiple subscribers)** | ✅ Yes                                                                 | ❌ No                                                              | ✅ Yes (via topics)                         |
| **Latency**                         | Millisecond scale                                                     | Moderate                                                          | Low, optimized for reliability             |

### 🔧 Real-World Analogy:

* **Event Grid** → *Doorbell* → Triggers action when someone presses it
* **Queue Storage** → *To-do list* → You check it regularly to see what to do
* **Service Bus** → *Registered mail with tracking* → Guaranteed delivery, order, retries

## 📂 **Immutability Policies vs Snapshots vs Versioning**

| Feature                | **Immutability Policy**                              | **Snapshot**                        | **Versioning**                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Enforce **compliance** (WORM: Write Once, Read Many) | **Manual backup** of blob           | **Auto backup** after changes           |
| **Mutable?**           | ❌ Cannot modify or delete during lock period         | ✅ Can delete or overwrite           | ✅ Can delete versions                   |
| **Use Case**           | Regulatory retention (e.g., finance, healthcare)     | Restore manually created state      | Auto recovery from accidental overwrite |
| **Activation**         | Must configure policy & retention period             | Call `snapshot` API manually        | Enabled at the storage account level    |
| **Cost Impact**        | Retention incurs storage cost                        | Snapshot incurs cost (differential) | Versions stored cost per GB             |
| **Visible in Portal?** | ✅ Yes (under blob > immutability)                    | ✅ Yes (under blob > snapshots)      | ✅ Yes (under blob > versions)           |
| **Granularity**        | Container or blob level                              | Per blob                            | Per blob                                |
| **Can be locked?**     | ✅ Yes (legal hold / time-based lock)                 | ❌ No                                | ❌ No                                    |

### 🧠 Quick Summary:

* **Immutability**: “I’m legally not allowed to change this blob for 7 years.”
* **Snapshot**: “Let me take a manual backup right now.”
* **Versioning**: “Every time I change this file, keep a copy.”

### ✅ You Should Master:

* When to use **Queue Storage** vs **Service Bus** vs **Event Grid**
* When to use **immutability** for compliance vs **snapshots** for backup vs **versioning** for overwrite recovery
