## üîπ 1. What is an Azure Storage Account?

An **Azure Storage Account** is a container that gives you access to Azure Storage services:

* **Blob Storage** (for unstructured data like images, videos)
* **File Storage** (for shared files via SMB)
* **Queue Storage** (for message queuing between components)
* **Table Storage** (for NoSQL key-value data)
* **Disk Storage** (for virtual machine disks)

---

## üîπ 2. Storage Account Types

| Type                    | Use Case                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Purpose v2**  | Default. Supports all features (Blob, Queue, Table, Disk) |
| **General Purpose v1**  | Legacy. Lower cost, fewer features                        |
| **Blob Storage**        | Optimized for blob storage only                           |
| **Premium Performance** | For high IOPS (mainly for Disks, Files)                   |

---

## üîπ 3. Performance Tiers

| Tier         | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard** | Backed by HDD. Cost-effective.               |
| **Premium**  | Backed by SSD. High throughput & low latency |

---

## üîπ 4. Access Tiers (Blob only)

| Tier        | Use Case                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Hot**     | Frequent access data                |
| **Cool**    | Infrequent access, stored ‚â• 30 days |
| **Archive** | Rare access, stored ‚â• 180 days      |

---

## üîπ 5. Redundancy Options

| Redundancy                          | Description                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **LRS** ‚Äì Locally redundant storage | 3 copies in same region        |
| **ZRS** ‚Äì Zone redundant storage    | Across AZs in same region      |
| **GRS** ‚Äì Geo-redundant storage     | Secondary region backup        |
| **RA-GRS** ‚Äì Read-access GRS        | GRS + read access to secondary |

GRS replicates data asynchronously to a paired region

## üîπ 6. Blob Storage Deep Dive

**Blob types**:

* **Block blobs** ‚Äì for files (images, logs, backups)
* **Append blobs** ‚Äì for logs (only append allowed)
* **Page blobs** ‚Äì for VHDs and disks (read/write random access)

### Blob URL structure:

```
https://<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blobname>
```

---

## üîπ 7. Security Features

* **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** ‚Äì Delegated access to resources
* **Azure AD Authentication** ‚Äì RBAC-based access control
* **Storage Account Keys** ‚Äì Full admin-level access (primary & secondary)
* **Encryption** ‚Äì Data encrypted at rest (Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys)

---

## üîê Azure Storage Security & Access Control

Azure offers **multiple ways to secure and access** your storage:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Shared Key Authorization (Account Keys)**

* Every storage account has **two 512-bit access keys**
* Using either key gives **full access** to all resources (blobs, files, queues, tables)
* Used in **code, apps, or tools like AzCopy**

**üî∫ Risk:** If leaked, it‚Äôs like handing out a master password

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**

SAS provides **fine-grained, time-limited access** to storage resources.

#### üî∏ Types of SAS:

| Type                    | Scope                               | Use Case Example                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **User Delegation SAS** | Per-user (uses Azure AD)            | Access granted to a signed-in user     |
| **Service SAS**         | Specific service (blob, file, etc.) | Grant access to a file for 1 hour      |
| **Account SAS**         | Whole account                       | Grant full read access to all services |

#### ‚öôÔ∏è With SAS, you can control:

* **Permissions** (read, write, delete, list, etc.)
* **Start/expiry time**
* **IP range restrictions**
* **Protocols** (HTTPS only)

**üß† Exam Tip:** Always prefer SAS over Account Key in production for security.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

* Uses **Azure AD identities** to control access to storage resources
* Supports **resource-level roles** like:

  * **Storage Blob Data Reader**
  * **Storage Blob Data Contributor**
* Works well for **serverless apps** or users authenticated via Azure AD

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Firewall & Virtual Network Rules**

* You can **restrict access** to your storage account from:

  * **Specific IP ranges**
  * **Virtual Networks (VNets)**
* Block access from public internet entirely if needed

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Private Endpoint**

* Maps your storage account to a **private IP** in your VNet
* Bypasses public internet ‚Äî ensures **100% private access**

---

## üß† Security Best Practices for AZ-204:

| Situation                      | Recommended Access Method     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Web/mobile app uploads blob    | SAS Token (via backend)       |
| Azure Function writing to blob | Azure RBAC + Managed Identity |
| Admin connecting from on-prem  | Account Key (short-term use)  |
| Enterprise app (long-term)     | Private Endpoint + RBAC       |

---


## üîπ 8. Monitoring and Diagnostics

* **Azure Monitor**
* **Metrics** (Request Count, Success Rate, Egress/Ingress, Latency)
* **Diagnostic Logs** (Access logs, latency, errors)
* **Soft delete** and **Versioning** for blobs

---

## üîπ 9. Developer Features (AZ-204 Focus)

* Use **Azure SDKs** for .NET, Python, Node.js
* Use **Azure.Storage.Blobs** package in .NET
* Upload/Download blobs
* Generate SAS tokens in code
* Set blob metadata & properties
* Async operations for file handling
* Use **QueueClient** for inserting and reading messages

---

## üîπ 10. ARM/Bicep & Terraform Support

Define storage account as Infrastructure-as-Code:

```bicep
resource stg 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: { name: 'Standard_LRS' }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  properties: {
    accessTier: 'Hot'
  }
}
```

---

## üîπ 11. Common Developer Use Cases

* Host static websites on Blob storage
* Upload large files in chunks
* Store logs and diagnostics (append blobs)
* Use Queue storage to decouple components
* Use Tables for structured NoSQL data
* Connect via REST API or SDKs

---

üîπ What is Rehydration in Azure Blob Storage?
When you store a blob in the Archive tier, the blob becomes offline ‚Äî you cannot read or modify it until it‚Äôs moved back to an online tier (Hot or Cool).
This process is called rehydration.
