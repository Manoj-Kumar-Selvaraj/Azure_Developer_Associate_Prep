## ✅ **Master Azure Entra – Detailed Topics List (Beginner to Pro)**

### 🔹 **1. Azure Entra Overview**

* What is Azure Entra?

---
    Azure Entra is Microsoft's modern identity and access management (IAM) solution. It includes tools to manage:
      Who can access?

      What they can access?

      When and under what conditions?
---

* Why Microsoft renamed Azure AD to Entra?

---
    | Reason                      | Explanation                                                                 |
    | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | ✅ **Clarity**               | "Azure AD" caused confusion with on-prem Active Directory.                  |
    | ✅ **Modern Identity Needs** | Entra expands into **cross-cloud, decentralized, and workload** identities. |
    | ✅ **Modular Architecture**  | Entra breaks down IAM into manageable, purpose-specific services.           |

## 🔹 **2. Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**

This is the **core service** within Entra that handles **identity and access** for users, devices, applications, and more.

### ✅ **Key Concepts You Must Master in Azure Entra ID**

---

### 🔸 **A. Tenants and Directories**

| Term                  | Meaning                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tenant**            | A dedicated, isolated instance of Azure Entra ID service (like your private directory in the cloud). |
| **Directory**         | Holds users, groups, apps, devices. One directory = one tenant.                                      |
| **Default Directory** | Created when you first sign up with Microsoft services (like M365, Azure).                           |
| **Tenant ID**         | A unique GUID for your tenant used in app registrations and configurations.                          |

🔹 **Example**:
You sign up for Azure → Microsoft creates a tenant like `manojkumar.onmicrosoft.com` → This is your **Azure Entra Directory**.

---

### 🔸 **B. Core Objects in Azure Entra**

| Object Type            | Examples                      | Purpose                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Users**              | Admins, employees, guests     | Who signs in                       |
| **Groups**             | Security / M365 groups        | Manage access                      |
| **Devices**            | Laptops, phones               | For compliance, conditional access |
| **Service Principals** | App identities                | Auth for apps                      |
| **Roles**              | Admin roles (e.g. User Admin) | Control permissions                |

---

### 🔸 **C. Users**

* **Create Users**: Portal, PowerShell, CLI
* **User Types**:

  * **Member**: Internal employee
  * **Guest**: External B2B partner
* **Properties**: Name, email, usage location, job title
* **Lifecycle**:

  * Create → Assign roles/groups → Use → Disable/Delete

🔹 You can also **bulk create users** using CSV or script.

---

### 🔸 **D. Groups**

* **Types**:

  * **Security Group**: For permissions
  * **Microsoft 365 Group**: Adds Teams, SharePoint, etc.
* **Membership**:

  * **Assigned**: Manually add members
  * **Dynamic**: Add members based on rules (e.g., department = "IT")

🔹 Example Rule:

```plaintext
(user.department -eq "IT")
```

* Use groups for **RBAC**, **Conditional Access**, and **Licensing**.

---

### 🔸 **E. Authentication Methods**

| Method                             | Description                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Password                           | Default                                        |
| **MFA** (Text, App, Hardware)      | Stronger, required for secure access           |
| Temporary Access Pass (TAP)        | One-time code for onboarding                   |
| Passwordless                       | FIDO2 keys, Authenticator app                  |
| Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) | User-initiated reset with verification methods |

---

### 🔸 **F. Azure Entra Roles & Admin Units**

* **Roles**:
  Predefined roles like:

  * **Global Administrator**
  * **User Administrator**
  * **Groups Administrator**

* **Admin Units** (like OUs in on-prem AD):
  Delegate admin rights to a **subset** of users/groups/devices.

---

### 🔸 **G. Device Registration & Management**

* Devices can be:

  * **Azure AD Registered**: BYOD (personal device)
  * **Azure AD Joined**: Corporate-owned
  * **Hybrid Azure AD Joined**: On-prem + Entra

🔹 Important for **Conditional Access**, **Intune**, **Compliance**
