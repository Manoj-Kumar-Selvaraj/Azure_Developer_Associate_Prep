## âœ… **Master Azure Entra â€“ Detailed Topics List (Beginner to Pro)**

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Azure Entra Overview**

* What is Azure Entra?
---
    Azure Entra is Microsoft's modern identity and access management (IAM) solution. It includes tools to manage:
    Who can access

    What they can access

    When and under what conditions
---

* Why Microsoft renamed Azure AD to Entra?

---
    | Reason                      | Explanation                                                                 |
    | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | âœ… **Clarity**               | "Azure AD" caused confusion with on-prem Active Directory.                  |
    | âœ… **Modern Identity Needs** | Entra expands into **cross-cloud, decentralized, and workload** identities. |
    | âœ… **Modular Architecture**  | Entra breaks down IAM into manageable, purpose-specific services.           |

* Core components of Azure Entra (ID, Permissions, Verified ID, Workload ID)

---
    | Azure Entra Component            | Description                                                                                     |
    | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Azure Entra ID**               | Formerly **Azure AD**. Core identity service for authentication, SSO, and directory management. |
    | **Entra Permissions Management** | Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) across AWS, Azure, GCP.                      |
    | **Entra Verified ID**            | Decentralized digital identity verification using open standards.                               |
    | **Entra Workload ID**            | Identity management for apps, services, containers, and functions (non-human identities).       |

    | Feature                  | Azure Entra ID (Cloud) | Active Directory (On-Prem) |
    | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | Protocols                | OAuth, OIDC, SAML      | Kerberos, NTLM             |
    | App support              | Cloud & Web Apps       | On-prem Windows apps       |
    | Location                 | Global cloud-based     | Local/Corporate network    |
    | MFA & Conditional Access | Built-in               | Requires add-ons           |
    | B2B & B2C                | Built-in               | Not native                 |
