# ðŸš€ Azure App Services: A-Z Hands-On Guide

We'll cover everything step by step:

### âœ… **Step 0: Prerequisites**

Make sure you've done the following:

* âœ… Installed Azure CLI: `az --version`
* âœ… Logged in: `az login` (or `az login --use-device-code`)
* âœ… Chosen a subscription:

```bash
az account set --subscription "<Your Subscription Name or ID>"
```

How to check your current subscription:

```bash
    az account show --query "name"
```
* âœ… Created a resource group (or you can create one in Step 1)

* âœ… Have a sample web app code ready (Node.js, Python, etc.) or be ready to create one
* âœ… Have a zip file ready for deployment (if you want to deploy a zip package)

---

## âœ… **Step 1: Create a Resource Group**

```bash
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
```

ðŸ“˜ A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources.

---

## âœ… **Step 2: Create an App Service Plan**

```bash
az appservice plan create \
  --name MyAppServicePlan \
  --resource-group Developer_Associate \
  --sku F1 \
  --is-linux
```
ðŸ”¹ `--sku F1` = Free tier
ðŸ”¹ `--is-linux` = Creates a Linux-based environment (optional, for Node.js/Python/etc.)

To list existing App Service Plans:

```
bash 
    az appservice plan list --resource-group Developer_Associate --output table
```

Note: 

* You can also use `--sku B1` for Basic tier or `--sku S1` for Standard tier, depending on your needs.
* If you want a Windows-based environment, omit `--is-linux`.
* App service plan is regional, so it will be created in the same region as your resource group.
* Since its regional, it wont be used for a app service created in different region.
* App Service Plans can host multiple web apps, so you can scale your applications easily.
* You can also scale up or down your App Service Plan later based on your needs.
* You can use the `--number-of-workers` parameter to specify how many instances you want to run your app on. For example, `--number-of-workers 2` will create two instances of your app.( This is horizontal scaling, which is different from vertical scaling where you increase the resources of a single instance.)
* You can also use the `--tags` parameter to add tags to your App Service Plan for better organization and management. For example, `--tags environment=production department=finance` will add these tags to your App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--location` parameter to specify a different region for your App Service Plan if you want to create it in a different region than your resource group. For example, `--location westus` will create your App Service Plan in the West US region.
* You can also use the `--max-burst` parameter to specify the maximum number of requests that your App Service Plan can handle at a time. For example, `--max-burst 100` will allow your App Service Plan to handle up to 100 requests at a time before throttling.
* You can also use the `--per-site-scaling` parameter to enable or disable per-site scaling for your App Service Plan. Per-site scaling allows you to scale each web app individually within the same App Service Plan, which can help you optimize resource usage and costs. For example, `--per-site-scaling true` will enable per-site scaling for your App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--reserved` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan is reserved or not. Reserved App Service Plans are dedicated to a single customer and provide better performance and reliability. For example, `--reserved true` will create a reserved App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--hyper-v` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan supports Hyper-V isolation or not. Hyper-V isolation provides better security and performance for your web apps by running them in isolated containers. For example, `--hyper-v true` will create an App Service Plan that supports Hyper-V isolation.
* You can also use the `--linux-fx-version` parameter to specify the runtime version for your Linux-based App Service Plan. For example, `--linux-fx-version "NODE|14-lts"` will create an App Service Plan that uses Node.js version 14 LTS as the runtime.
* You can also use the `--windows-fx-version` parameter to specify the runtime version for your Windows-based App Service Plan. For example, `--windows-fx-version "DOTNET|6.0"` will create an App Service Plan that uses .NET version 6.0 as the runtime.
* You can also use the `--client-affinity-enabled` parameter to enable or disable client affinity for your App Service Plan. Client affinity allows your web apps to maintain session state across multiple requests from the same client, which can improve user experience and performance. For example, `--client-affinity-enabled true` will enable client affinity for your App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--scm-site` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan has a separate SCM site or not. The SCM site is used for deployment and management of your web apps, and having a separate SCM site can improve performance and security. For example, `--scm-site true` will create an App Service Plan with a separate SCM site.
* You can also use the `--https-only` parameter to enforce HTTPS for your App Service Plan. This ensures that all traffic to your web apps is secure and encrypted. For example, `--https-only true` will enable HTTPS only for your App Service Plan.
*   You can also use the `--auto-heal-enabled` parameter to enable or disable auto-healing for your App Service Plan. Auto-healing automatically restarts your web apps if they become unresponsive or unhealthy, which can improve reliability and availability. For example, `--auto-heal-enabled true` will enable auto-healing for your App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--scaling-enabled` parameter to enable or disable scaling for your App Service Plan. Scaling allows you to adjust the number of instances and resources allocated to your web apps based on demand, which can help you optimize performance and costs. For example, `--scaling-enabled true` will enable scaling for your App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--suspended` parameter to suspend or resume your App Service Plan. Suspending an App Service Plan stops all web apps and resources associated with it, while resuming it restarts them. For example, `--suspended true` will suspend your App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--is-public` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan is public or private.

* You can also use the `--is-spot` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan is a spot instance or not. Spot instances are low-cost, interruptible instances that can be used for non-critical workloads. For example, `--is-spot true` will create a spot instance App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--is-ssl` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan supports SSL or not. SSL support allows you to secure your web apps with SSL certificates, which can improve security and trustworthiness. For example, `--is-ssl true` will create an App Service Plan that supports SSL.
* You can also use the `--is-geo-redundant` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan is geo-redundant or not. Geo-redundant App Service Plans replicate your web apps and resources across multiple regions for better availability and disaster recovery. For example, `--is-geo-redundant true` will create a geo-redundant App Service Plan.
* You can also use the `--is-traffic-manager` parameter to specify whether your App Service Plan supports Traffic Manager or not. Traffic Manager allows you to distribute traffic across multiple web apps and regions for better performance and reliability. For example, `--is-traffic-manager true` will create an App Service Plan that supports Traffic Manager.

## âœ… **Step 3: Create a Web App**

Choose a runtime. Example: Node.js

```bash
az webapp create \
  --resource-group Developer_Associate \
  --plan MyAppServicePlan \
  --name mywebapp$RANDOM \
  --runtime "NODE|22-lts"
```

ðŸ“Œ Replace `NODE|22-lts` with other runtimes if needed (e.g., `DOTNETCORE|6.0`, `PYTHON|3.10`, etc.)
ðŸ“Œ `mywebapp$RANDOM` ensures a unique name globally.

---

## âœ… **Step 4: Deploy Code to Web App**

### Option 1: Deploy ZIP Package

#### Create a folder structure for the code

nodeapp/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ .zip (will be created)


```bash
az webapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group Developer_Associate \
  --name mywebapp6176 \
  --src nodeapp.zip
```

ðŸ“¦ Make sure you zip your app before deploying.

---

### Option 2: Local Git Deployment

```bash
az webapp deployment source config-local-git \
  --name <your-webapp-name> \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

It returns a Git URL â†’ use it to push code:

```bash
git remote add azure <deployment-git-url>
git push azure master
```

---

## âœ… **Step 5: Configure App Settings (Environment Variables)**

```bash
az webapp config appsettings set \
  --name <your-webapp-name> \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --settings "ENV=Production" "DEBUG=False"
```

---

## âœ… **Step 6: Enable Application Logs**

```bash
az webapp log config \
  --name <your-webapp-name> \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --application-logging true
```

To stream logs:

```bash
az webapp log tail \
  --name <your-webapp-name> \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

---

## âœ… **Step 7: Create and Swap Deployment Slots**

```bash
az webapp deployment slot create \
  --name <your-webapp-name> \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --slot staging
```

To swap:

```bash
az webapp deployment slot swap \
  --name <your-webapp-name> \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --slot staging
```

---

## âœ… **Step 8: Clean Up (Optional)**

```bash
az group delete --name MyResourceGroup --no-wait --yes
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Ready to Practice?

Letâ€™s start step-by-step. You can do:

âœ… Step 1: Create resource group
Then send me a âœ… and weâ€™ll move to Step 2.

Would you like me to generate a zip file with a sample web app (like Node.js or Python) for your test deployment?
