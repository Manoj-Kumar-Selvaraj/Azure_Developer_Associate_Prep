| **Live Metrics Stream**        | Real-time metrics (request rate, failure rate, CPU/mem) for .NET apps. |
| **Smart Detection**            | Automatically finds anomalies (like spike in failures).                |
| **Sampling**                   | Reduces telemetry sent, keeps performance data accurate.               |
| **Availability Tests**         | Ping tests from multiple Azure regions.                                |
| **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** | Use it in Logs tab to run analytics queries.                           |

#### 🔥 Must-Memorize:

* **`customEvents`** = table for app-generated telemetry.
* **`requests`** = incoming HTTP request logs.
* **`dependencies`** = outgoing calls like SQL/HTTP.
* **`exceptions`** = caught or uncaught app errors.
* **`traces`** = trace logs from your app.

---

### 🔹 **2. Azure Monitor**

#### 🧠 What it is:

* Centralized monitoring service for **all Azure resources**.
* Connects with: Logs (via Log Analytics), Metrics, Alerts, Dashboards.

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

| Feature                 | Details                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metrics**             | Numeric, time-series data. Fast alerts.                                                                               |

| **Dashboards**          | Visualization tool — not interactive like Workbooks.                                                                  |
| **Workbooks**           | Interactive reports with KQL, charts, dropdowns, parameters.                                                          |
| **Diagnostic Settings** | Enable logging for resources (e.g., App Service, Function Apps) to send data to Log Analytics, Storage, or Event Hub. |

---

### 🔹 **3. Alerts**

| Type                   | Use When                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Metric Alert**       | Real-time, numeric threshold (e.g., CPU > 80%). |
| **Log Alert**          | Based on KQL query (e.g., requests > 500ms).    |
| **Activity Log Alert** | Detects Azure-level events (e.g., VM deleted).  |
| **Smart Detection**    | AI-based anomaly alerting (App Insights).       |

🧠 Metric alerts are **fastest**, **not stored in logs**, and don't require Log Analytics.

---

### 🔹 **4. Diagnostic Logs**

* Use `az monitor diagnostic-settings create` or via portal.
* For most Azure services (App Service, Key Vault, Cosmos DB, etc.), **enable diagnostic logging** to push logs to:

  * **Log Analytics** (for querying)
  * **Storage Account** (for archival)
  * **Event Hub** (for external tools like Splunk)

---

### 🔹 **5. Kusto Query Language (KQL) Basics**

```kusto
requests
| where resultCode == "500"
| summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)
```

* `requests`, `dependencies`, `exceptions`, `customMetrics` are common tables.
* `summarize`, `project`, `join`, `extend` — are useful KQL operators.

| Alerts for Azure Resource events? | **Activity Log Alerts**                          |
| Visualize dependencies?           | **Application Map**                              |
| Dashboards vs Workbooks?          | **Workbooks** are dynamic, Dashboards are static |
| Ingest logs into KQL?             | Use **Log Analytics** workspace                  |
| Export logs externally?           | Use **Diagnostic Settings** + Event Hub          |
| Save logs for years?              | Use **Storage Account** with Diagnostic Settings |
| Query slow endpoints?             | Use `requests` table in App Insights             |

---

#### **1. `✔️ c) dependencies`**

✅ Correct! The `dependencies` table shows external service calls like SQL, HTTP, etc., and is perfect for diagnosing performance issues in Azure Functions and App Services.

---

#### **2. `✔️ c) Enable App Insights auto-instrumentation from the App Service blade`**

✅ Spot on. This requires no code changes. The App Service blade offers a toggle for automatic Application Insights integration.

---

#### **3. `✔️ c) Azure Monitor Metric Alerts`**

✅ Correct. Metric Alerts provide **real-time** alerts, unlike logs which may have a slight delay due to ingestion.

---

#### **4. `✔️ c) Application Map`**

✅ Correct! Application Map shows **component relationships**, request flows, error hotspots, and dependency health visually.

---

#### **5. `❌ b) Log Analytics` → Correct: `c) Storage Account`**

❗ Log Analytics is for querying logs, **not** the most cost-effective archival. For cheap, long-term retention, **Storage Account** is preferred.

---

#### **6. `✔️ b) Send logs to Event Hub`**

✅ Correct. Event Hub is used when forwarding logs to third-party tools like Splunk or Datadog.

---

#### **7. `✔️ c) Smart Detection`**

✅ Right again. Smart Detection uses ML to flag anomalies like sudden error spikes or latency increases.

---

#### **8. `❌ d) Activity Log Alert` → Correct: `c) Log Analytics Alert using KQL`**

❗ Activity Logs capture **control-plane** operations (e.g., VM stop/start), not app-level behavior.
You need **KQL in Log Analytics** to count failed requests in a time window.

---

#### **9. `❌ a) customEvents` → Correct: `c) requests`**

❗ `customEvents` are for **manual** telemetry.
The `requests` table tracks **incoming HTTP requests**, including their response time and status.

---

#### **10. `✔️ d) Can directly modify resource configurations`**

✅ Correct. Workbooks are **read-only dashboards**. They’re great for analytics but **cannot configure** Azure resources.
