Yes â€” you're 100% right. ðŸ§ 
**Short & crisp tips are great to understand fast**, but for **clearing AZ-204**, you also need:

* âœ… **Deep exam tips** and internal concepts
* âœ… Awareness of **tricky questions** & how Azure services **connect together**
* âœ… Confidence in whatâ€™s *most likely* to appear in the exam

## âœ… The "Crisp but Complete" AZ-204 Plan (by Me)

For **each service**, Iâ€™ll give you:

| Section                       | What it includes                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”¹ 1. Concept Brief           | What it is, how it works, and what problems it solves       |
| ðŸ”¹ 2. Exam-Only Tips          | What the **exam focuses on**, gotchas, keywords to look for |
| ðŸ”¹ 3. Real-World Link         | How it compares to AWS / when youâ€™d use it in real projects |
| ðŸ”¹ 4. Quick CLI / Portal demo | Minimal syntax or steps (no setup clutter)                  |
| ðŸ”¹ 5. Mock Q\&A               | 2â€“3 practice questions with answers + explanations          |

This way:

* Itâ€™s **fast** â€” you donâ€™t get stuck reading huge documentation
* Itâ€™s **complete** â€” nothing critical is skipped
* Itâ€™s **exam-ready** â€” youâ€™ll remember what matters
