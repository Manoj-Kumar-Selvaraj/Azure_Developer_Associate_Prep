---

These topics are important to **master** for the AZ-204 exam and real-world use. Here’s a **quick breakdown with examples** for each of them, so you can **understand and remember** clearly:

---

## 🔹 **Windows vs Linux App Service Plans**

| Feature                      | **Windows Plan**                        | **Linux Plan**                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Runtimes**                 | .NET Framework, .NET Core, Node.js, PHP | Node.js, Python, PHP, .NET Core, Java |
| **Custom Containers**        | Limited (via Windows containers)        | ✅ Full Docker container support       |
| **Kudu (Advanced Tools)**    | ✅ Available                             | ❌ Not available on built-in images    |
| **Startup file config**      | Not needed (uses web.config)            | ✅ Needs `startup command` for apps    |
| **Cold start on free plans** | Present                                 | Present                               |

➡️ **Use Linux for**: custom Docker, lightweight, open-source workloads.
➡️ **Use Windows for**: legacy .NET Framework apps.

---

## 🔹 **App Service Deployment Center (GUI CI/CD)**

> A **portal-based wizard** to configure CI/CD.

📍Steps:

1. Go to **App Service → Deployment Center**
2. Select source: GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, etc.
3. Choose branch, build provider (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines)
4. Auto-creates CI/CD pipeline

✅ **Benefit**: No need to manually configure GitHub Actions/YAML
✅ Ideal for first-time deployments

---

## 🔹 **Identity Providers for Authentication (Easy Auth)**

App Service has **built-in authentication**.

Supported identity providers:

* ✅ Azure Active Directory
* ✅ Google
* ✅ Facebook
* ✅ Twitter
* ✅ Microsoft (MSA)
* ✅ GitHub

📌 You configure them in:
**App Service → Authentication → Identity Providers**

> When enabled, App Service protects endpoints (like `/home`) and automatically handles login/logout.

---

## 🔹 **Managed Identity to Access Other Azure Resources**

🎯 Use **Managed Identity** instead of storing secrets in code/config.

### Example:

Want to connect App Service to **Azure SQL securely**.

Steps:

1. Enable **System-assigned managed identity** in App Service
2. Go to Azure SQL → Add Active Directory admin → Grant the app identity access (e.g., `db_datareader`)
3. In code, use `DefaultAzureCredential()` (if using SDK)

✅ No secrets stored
✅ Works for: Azure SQL, Key Vault, Storage, etc.

---

## 🔹 **Access Restrictions (IP / Service Endpoints)**

📍Set rules to restrict incoming traffic.

App Service → **Networking → Access Restrictions**

You can allow:

* Certain IPs / CIDR ranges
* Subnets from VNETs
* Service Endpoints (e.g., from private resources)

✅ Blocks unauthorized access
✅ Helps meet security and compliance needs

---

## 🔹 **App Insights (Powerful Monitoring Tool)**

Azure Application Insights (App Insights):

* Tracks: requests, failures, dependencies, performance, logs
* Has live metrics, alerts, query logs with KQL
* Deep performance insights (e.g., SQL calls, HTTP latency)

✅ Enable via App Service → Application Insights
✅ View logs in **Log Analytics**

---

## 🔹 **Store Logs Centrally: Log Analytics Workspace**

If using App Insights or Azure Monitor, logs can be:

* Sent to **Log Analytics** workspace
* Queried via **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**

Example KQL query:

```kql
AppRequests
| where success == false
| summarize count() by operation_Name
```

📍 Benefits:

* Unified logging for multiple apps
* Long-term retention
* Advanced queries/alerts

---

## 🔹 **Azure Monitor Logs**

Azure Monitor collects:

* **Metrics**: CPU %, memory, response time
* **Logs**: HTTP requests, exceptions, traces

Use with:

* App Service
* Azure Functions
* AKS, VMs, etc.

✅ You can create:

* Dashboards
* Alerts (e.g., “500 errors > 10 in 5 mins”)
* Auto-scale triggers

---

# APP FUNCTIONS

Understanding `.json` config files and the **Triggers**, **Input Bindings**, and **Output Bindings** is *critical* for mastering Azure Functions — both for **AZ-204** and real-world use. Let's break this down clearly and thoroughly.

---

## ✅ **Key JSON Files in Azure Functions**

### 1. `function.json`

Defines metadata for **a specific function**: its **trigger**, **input**, and **output** bindings.

#### 🧩 Structure:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "authLevel": "function",
      "methods": ["get", "post"]
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out"
    }
  ],
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py"
}
```

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

| Property     | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`       | Trigger type (e.g., `httpTrigger`, `queueTrigger`, `blobTrigger`) or binding type (`queue`, `table`, etc.) |
| `name`       | Variable name used in code                                                                                 |
| `direction`  | `in` or `out`                                                                                              |
| `authLevel`  | `anonymous`, `function`, or `admin` (only for HTTP triggers)                                               |
| `methods`    | HTTP methods (for HTTP trigger)                                                                            |
| `scriptFile` | Path to function code (default `index.js`, `run.csx`, or `__init__.py`)                                    |

---

### 2. `host.json`

Controls **global configuration** for all functions in an app.

#### 🧩 Example:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "functionTimeout": "00:10:00",
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "maxTelemetryItemsPerSecond": 5
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": "api"
    },
    "queues": {
      "maxDequeueCount": 5,
      "visibilityTimeout": "00:00:30"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 🧠 Common Settings:

| Setting                       | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `functionTimeout`             | Max function runtime (e.g. "00:05:00")                  |
| `extensions.http.routePrefix` | Base path for HTTP routes (empty string removes `/api`) |
| `queues.maxDequeueCount`      | Retry count before poison queue                         |
| `logging`                     | App Insights settings                                   |

---

### 3. `local.settings.json` (only for **local dev**)

Contains **environment variables** and local config for the runtime emulator.

#### 🧩 Example:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "MySecretKey": "12345"
  },
  "Host": {
    "CORS": "*"
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Not deployed to Azure. Used by **local dev tools and emulator**.

---

## ✅ Triggers, Input Bindings, Output Bindings

### 🔹 **Trigger** (Exactly ONE per function)

**Starts the function**.

| Trigger Type        | Usage                |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `httpTrigger`       | REST calls           |
| `queueTrigger`      | Azure Queue          |
| `blobTrigger`       | New file in Blob     |
| `timerTrigger`      | Cron jobs            |
| `eventGridTrigger`  | Event Grid           |
| `serviceBusTrigger` | Service Bus messages |

---

### 🔸 **Input Binding** (Optional)

**Reads data** into the function from a service (like a database, blob, queue).

| Type       | Example Usage                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| `blob`     | Read file content             |
| `queue`    | Read queue message            |
| `table`    | Read a row from Table Storage |
| `cosmosDB` | Query from CosmosDB           |

---

### 🔸 **Output Binding** (Optional)

**Writes data** from the function to an external service.

| Type       | Example Usage            |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `queue`    | Add message to queue     |
| `blob`     | Save file                |
| `table`    | Insert/update table row  |
| `cosmosDB` | Add document to CosmosDB |
| `sendGrid` | Send email               |
| `eventHub` | Publish message          |

---

### 🧩 Example: Queue Trigger with Output Binding to Blob

#### `function.json`:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "queueItem",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "queueName": "myqueue",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    },
    {
      "name": "outputBlob",
      "type": "blob",
      "path": "outputcontainer/{queueTrigger}.txt",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage",
      "direction": "out"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Python Example:

```python
def main(queueItem: str, outputBlob: func.Out[str]):
    outputBlob.set(f"Processed: {queueItem}")
```

## 🧠 Tips to Memorize Quickly

* ✅ `function.json` → Per-function config: Triggers & bindings

* ✅ `host.json` → App-wide config: timeouts, retries, logging

* ✅ `local.settings.json` → Only for local: secrets, env vars

* 🔹 One trigger per function

* 🔸 Optional input/output bindings

* 📦 Output bindings use `func.Out[]` in code (Python/C#)
---

## ✅ A–Z Guide for Azure Functions (for AZ-204 Developer Associate)

---

### 🔹 **A. What is Azure Functions?**

* Serverless compute service.
* You write just the code; Azure handles infrastructure.
* Event-driven (run on triggers like HTTP, Timer, Queue, etc.)

---

### 🔹 **B. Hosting Plans**

| Plan                        | Cold Start | Scaling             | Duration                | VNET  | Pricing           |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| **Consumption**             | ❌ Yes      | Auto                | 5 mins default (max 60) | ❌ No  | Pay per execution |
| **Premium**                 | ✅ No       | Auto + min instance | Unlimited               | ✅ Yes | More costly       |
| **Dedicated (App Service)** | ✅ No       | Manual              | Unlimited               | ✅ Yes | Flat cost         |

---

### 🔹 **C. Triggers (What starts the function?)**

* **HTTP Trigger** – On web requests (GET/POST)
* **Timer Trigger** – Based on CRON schedule
* **Queue Trigger** – From Azure Storage Queue
* **Service Bus Trigger** – From Service Bus messages
* **Event Hub Trigger** – High-speed event ingestion
* **Blob Trigger** – When a file is added/updated
* **Cosmos DB Trigger** – On DB change feed

---

### 🔹 **D. Input/Output Bindings (How functions get/set data)**

Bindings let your function **interact with external resources** without writing plumbing code.

| Binding Type | Direction | Example               |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------- |
| Blob         | In/Out    | Image processing      |
| Queue        | In/Out    | Message queuing       |
| Cosmos DB    | In/Out    | Read/write documents  |
| Table        | In/Out    | Table storage         |
| SignalR      | Out       | Real-time updates     |
| HTTP         | In/Out    | HTTP request/response |

---

### 🔹 **E. function.json – Trigger & Binding Definition**

Example:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["get", "post"]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔹 **F. host.json – Runtime Configuration (Global or Per-Trigger)**

Example:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "functionTimeout": "00:05:00",
  "extensions": {
    "queues": {
      "batchSize": 16,
      "newBatchThreshold": 8
    },
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": "api",
      "maxConcurrentRequests": 100
    }
  },
  "retry": {
    "strategy": "fixedDelay",
    "maxRetryCount": 5,
    "delayInterval": "00:00:05"
  }
}
```

---

### 🔹 **G. local.settings.json – Local Development Settings**

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<connection string>",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python"
  }
}
```

---

### 🔹 **H. Authorization Levels (for HTTP Trigger)**

| Level     | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Anonymous | No key required           |
| Function  | Requires function key     |
| Admin     | Requires master/admin key |

---

### 🔹 **I. Retry Policies (host.json)**

```json
"retry": {
  "strategy": "exponentialBackoff",
  "maxRetryCount": 5,
  "minimumInterval": "00:00:02",
  "maximumInterval": "00:01:00"
}
```

---

### 🔹 **J. Durable Functions (Orchestration)**

Use for:

* Workflows
* Human approvals
* Fan-out/Fan-in
* External event waiting

Key patterns:

* `CallActivityAsync` – Run small task
* `Task.WhenAll(...)` – Parallel tasks

Use **Application Settings** or **Key Vault + Managed Identity**:

```json
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://vault/secrets/connection)"
```

---

### 🔹 **Q. Bindings Advanced Scenarios**

Example: HTTP in + Cosmos DB out

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "function",
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in"
    },
    {
      "type": "cosmosDB",
      "name": "outputDoc",
      "direction": "out",
      "databaseName": "mydb",
      "collectionName": "items",
      "createIfNotExists": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔹 **R. Error Handling**

* Retry policies (host.json)
* Manual retry with Durable Functions
* Try/catch blocks in code
* Poison message queue (for failed queue processing)

---

### 🔹 **S. Timer Trigger – CRON Format**

```json
"schedule": "0 */5 * * * *" // Every 5 minutes
```

Format: `second minute hour day month day-of-week`

---

### 🔹 **T. Function Timeout**

* Set in `host.json`

```json
"functionTimeout": "00:10:00"
```

* Default for Consumption = 5 min
* Max for Consumption = 60 min
* Premium = Unlimited

---

### 🔹 **U. Languages Supported**

* C#
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Python
* Java
* PowerShell
* Custom handlers

---

### 🔹 **V. Durable Task Status**

Query orchestration status using HTTP API:

```
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/{instanceId}
```

---

### 🔹 **W. Cost Optimization**

* Use **Consumption Plan** for bursty workloads.
* Disable Always On if not needed.
* Avoid excessive retries.

---

### 🔹 **X. Bindings vs Triggers**

* **Trigger** = Starts the function (must be only one)
* **Binding** = Input or Output data sources (can be many)

---

### 🔹 **Y. Logging**

Use:

* `ILogger` in .NET
* `context.log()` in JavaScript/Python
* View logs in App Insights or Log Analytics

---

### 🔹 **Z. Best Practices**

* Use environment-specific settings
* Avoid cold starts with Premium
* Secure secrets with Key Vault
* Use Durable Functions for long workflows
* Monitor via Application Insights
