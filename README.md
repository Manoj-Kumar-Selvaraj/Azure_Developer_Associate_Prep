## ✅ The "Crisp but Complete" AZ-204 Plan (by Me)

For **each service**, I’ll give you:

| Section                       | What it includes                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 1. Concept Brief           | What it is, how it works, and what problems it solves       |
| 🔹 2. Exam-Only Tips          | What the **exam focuses on**, gotchas, keywords to look for |
| 🔹 3. Real-World Link         | How it compares to AWS / when you’d use it in real projects |
| 🔹 4. Quick CLI / Portal demo | Minimal syntax or steps (no setup clutter)                  |
| 🔹 5. Mock Q\&A               | 2–3 practice questions with answers + explanations          |

This way:

* It’s **fast** — you don’t get stuck reading huge documentation
* It’s **complete** — nothing critical is skipped
* It’s **exam-ready** — you’ll remember what matters

## 🧠 App Service Plan Tiers – Exam-Crucial Comparison

| Tier               | Key Features                                                                | Exam Notes 🔥                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**           | - Shared infra<br>- No custom domains<br>- No SLAs                          | For learning only; **no scaling**, **no custom domains** |
| **Shared**         | - Shared CPU<br>- Limited quota<br>- Custom domains **allowed**             | Still no auto-scaling                                    |
| **Basic**          | - Dedicated VM<br>- Custom domains<br>- Manual scaling only                 | No **auto-scale**                                        |
| **Standard**       | - Auto-scale support<br>- 5 deployment slots<br>- Daily backup              | **Most popular in real world**                           |
| **Premium v2**     | - Better performance<br>- VNET integration<br>- More instances & slots (20) | Good for **secure/high traffic** apps                    |
| **Premium v3**     | - Latest Gen VMs<br>- More RAM, faster<br>- Zone redundancy                 | Recommended for **production**                           |
| **Isolated (ASE)** | - Runs in your VNET<br>- High scale<br>- Fully isolated compute             | Expensive, but **fully private & secure**                |

---

## 🔥 Key Exam Tips

* **Auto-scale starts at Standard**
* **Deployment slots** = 5 (Standard), 20 (Premium)
* **Custom domains** = Shared and above (not Free)
* **VNET Integration** = Premium or Isolated only
* **Backups** = Standard and above
* **WebSockets** = Standard and above
* **SSL Binding from Key Vault** = App Service supports it directly
* **Container Support** = Needs **Linux-based App Service Plan**

---

These topics are important to **master** for the AZ-204 exam and real-world use. Here’s a **quick breakdown with examples** for each of them, so you can **understand and remember** clearly:

---

## 🔹 **Windows vs Linux App Service Plans**

| Feature                      | **Windows Plan**                        | **Linux Plan**                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Runtimes**                 | .NET Framework, .NET Core, Node.js, PHP | Node.js, Python, PHP, .NET Core, Java |
| **Custom Containers**        | Limited (via Windows containers)        | ✅ Full Docker container support       |
| **Kudu (Advanced Tools)**    | ✅ Available                             | ❌ Not available on built-in images    |
| **Startup file config**      | Not needed (uses web.config)            | ✅ Needs `startup command` for apps    |
| **Cold start on free plans** | Present                                 | Present                               |

➡️ **Use Linux for**: custom Docker, lightweight, open-source workloads.
➡️ **Use Windows for**: legacy .NET Framework apps.

---

## 🔹 **App Service Deployment Center (GUI CI/CD)**

> A **portal-based wizard** to configure CI/CD.

📍Steps:

1. Go to **App Service → Deployment Center**
2. Select source: GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, etc.
3. Choose branch, build provider (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines)
4. Auto-creates CI/CD pipeline

✅ **Benefit**: No need to manually configure GitHub Actions/YAML
✅ Ideal for first-time deployments

---

## 🔹 **Identity Providers for Authentication (Easy Auth)**

App Service has **built-in authentication**.

Supported identity providers:

* ✅ Azure Active Directory
* ✅ Google
* ✅ Facebook
* ✅ Twitter
* ✅ Microsoft (MSA)
* ✅ GitHub

📌 You configure them in:
**App Service → Authentication → Identity Providers**

> When enabled, App Service protects endpoints (like `/home`) and automatically handles login/logout.

---

## 🔹 **Managed Identity to Access Other Azure Resources**

🎯 Use **Managed Identity** instead of storing secrets in code/config.

### Example:

Want to connect App Service to **Azure SQL securely**.

Steps:

1. Enable **System-assigned managed identity** in App Service
2. Go to Azure SQL → Add Active Directory admin → Grant the app identity access (e.g., `db_datareader`)
3. In code, use `DefaultAzureCredential()` (if using SDK)

✅ No secrets stored
✅ Works for: Azure SQL, Key Vault, Storage, etc.

---

## 🔹 **Access Restrictions (IP / Service Endpoints)**

📍Set rules to restrict incoming traffic.

App Service → **Networking → Access Restrictions**

You can allow:

* Certain IPs / CIDR ranges
* Subnets from VNETs
* Service Endpoints (e.g., from private resources)

✅ Blocks unauthorized access
✅ Helps meet security and compliance needs

---

## 🔹 **App Insights (Powerful Monitoring Tool)**

Azure Application Insights (App Insights):

* Tracks: requests, failures, dependencies, performance, logs
* Has live metrics, alerts, query logs with KQL
* Deep performance insights (e.g., SQL calls, HTTP latency)

✅ Enable via App Service → Application Insights
✅ View logs in **Log Analytics**

---

## 🔹 **Store Logs Centrally: Log Analytics Workspace**

If using App Insights or Azure Monitor, logs can be:

* Sent to **Log Analytics** workspace
* Queried via **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**

Example KQL query:

```kql
AppRequests
| where success == false
| summarize count() by operation_Name
```

📍 Benefits:

* Unified logging for multiple apps
* Long-term retention
* Advanced queries/alerts

---

## 🔹 **Azure Monitor Logs**

Azure Monitor collects:

* **Metrics**: CPU %, memory, response time
* **Logs**: HTTP requests, exceptions, traces

Use with:

* App Service
* Azure Functions
* AKS, VMs, etc.

✅ You can create:

* Dashboards
* Alerts (e.g., “500 errors > 10 in 5 mins”)
* Auto-scale triggers

---
